Description: Whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and 
    decompression of raw vectors. If not already installed,
    provides both the 'libdeflate' static library 
    (see <https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate>) and 'C' headers.
    Also provides a 'CMake' target to ease the static linking
    of 'libdeflate' in other packages.
    Compared to base R's 'memCompress()' implementation of DEFLATE compression, 
    this R interface provides the user with additional 
    control over the trade-off between speed and quality of 
    compression.
